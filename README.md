The file Generator_code.ipynb contains the code used to generate the exact excitation spectra given the values of aL and the range of modes in question.
The files a_arr_3.npy, n_range_3.npy and P_spectrum_3.npy have the data previously generated as used in the paper 'Kinematics of acceleration-induced excitations in confined quantum fields', https://doi.org/10.1103/2sss-by9v.
The file Useful_Plots.ipynb contains the code used to generate the plots from the data generated.
